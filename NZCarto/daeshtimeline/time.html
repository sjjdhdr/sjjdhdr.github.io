								<h2>Timeline: Daesh in Pakistan</h2>
                                <i>By Arfeen Syed</i>
                                <p>In Iraq and Syria, Daesh is on the back foot, losing fighters as well as the territories it once controlled. As a result, the group has opened up new theatres of operations across the region and claiming devastating attacks in Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon, France, Belgium, Bangladesh, Philippines, Afghanistan and most recently Pakistan.</p>
                                <p>Already racked by plethora of terrorist groups since the turn of the millennium, the first breadcrumbs of a trail leading to Daesh in Pakistan appeared in 2014.</p>
                                <p>Since then, the terrorist organisation has claimed several bomb and gun attacks mostly in the Balochistan and Sindh province. It is still unclear if the group has a direct setup in the country or if it is drawing from an existing pool of militants, often termed by the security authorities as ‘Daesh sympathisers’.</p>
                                <p>Here, Geo.TV compiles a timeline of incidents and developments in Pakistan, which are linked with Daesh:</p>

            A few days earlier, the resident of Al-Azhar Garden in Karachi received threatening letters and emails from Daesh Khurasan. The Ismaili community that resides in the area was warned to withdraw witnesses in the Safoora attack case, otherwise they will be targeted again.

            The counter terrorism department in Punjab alerts local authorities about the presence of Daesh affiliated militants in the province, plotting to attack media channels in Islamabad.

            <br>
            “Once again, the next safe haven for fleeing militants from Syria and Iraq would be Afghanistan where its presence has already been established. This is a worrisome phenomenon because ultimately they will strike in Pakistan,” cautions a CTD spokesman.

			<span class="thumb-timeline-type">The Islamic State says it was behind the storming of a police training college in Quetta, Balochistan that killed 60 cadets. Officials in Balochistan insist that the banned Lashkar-e- Jhangvi Al Almi, not ISIS, carried out the assault. Geo. TV spoke to Ali Bin Sufyan, Almi’s spokesperson, following the attack.  “The suicide bombers were provided by the Islamic State. We are under the command of Emirate Islami (Afghan Taliban), but we will provide support to any organization waging jihad in Pakistan,” said Sufyan.

Over 309 people, including foreign nationals, have been arrested in connection to the terror outfit, he says in a press briefing, adding that authorities have thwarted planned ISIS attacks on foreign embassies and the Islamabad airport. This is the first admission by a Pakistani official of ISIS’s footprints in Pakistan. The local leader of the outfit is identified as Hafiz Umar, a Karachi resident.
            <br>
            <br>
            Later that month, the Sindh government places Rs.2 million bounty on the head of Umar. The 35-year-old militant has personally overseen the bus attack as well as the one that killed Sabeen Mahmud. He was arrested in November and convicted to death by a military court.</span>

			<span class="thumb-timeline-type">Aftab Sultan, director general of the Intelligence Bureau, states before the Senate Standing Committee on Interior that Daesh was emerging as a threat in the country because several militant groups, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, have a soft corner for it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Two days later, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar rubbishes Sultan’s statement. Nisar at a media gathering says, "Daesh does not exist in Pakistan. Other terrorist groups, which are involved in activities against the state are using Daesh's name and are causing death and destruction in the country.”
            <br>
            <br>
A report by the UK-based Royal United Services Institute estimate 7,000 to 8,000 Daesh members based in Afghanistan and 2,000 to 3,000 based in Pakistan, including fighters and support elements.</span>

The militants fire indiscriminately at the passengers, killing 45 and injuring over 13 people. Both the Pakistani Taliban and Daesh claimed responsibility for the gun attack. However, Pakistan’s foreign office dismisses the Daesh claim and denies its footprints in the country.
<br>
<br>
Seven days later Sindh’s counter terror authority tracks down Saad Aziz, and four others, suspected of involvement in the Safoora carnage. Subsequent investigations reveal a network of educated, middle-class professionals who bankroll and plan for Daesh in Pakistan. According to a confidential joint interrogation report, seen by Geo.TV, a militant Abdullah Yousaf, travelled from Syria to Karachi to plan the attack. A senior police official, privy to the interrogation, told Geo.TV that Aziz, a university graduate, was running a restaurant at the time of his arrest. The eatery was a front, used to gain access to foreign consulates in Karachi. Last year, a military court convicted Aziz and others, also charged with murdering activist Sabeen Mahmud, to death.</span>

Kohat, previously associated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), has been tasked to reach out to disgruntled members of the TTP, Sipah-e-Sahaba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, as well as set up an office in the garrison city and his hometown of Rawalpindi.
 <br>
            <br>
The Home Department Balochistan issues a similar notification. “It is reliably learnt that Daesh has offered some elements of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat to join hands with it in Pakistan [sic].” The letter warns that both terror outfits have been assigned to target the Shia community in the province. “Daesh has gathered 10,000 to 12,000 followers from Hangu and the Kurram Agency. They intend to carry out multifaceted attacks on law enforcement agencies and important government installation.”

Shahidullah Shahid, TTP’s former spokesperson, along with five commanders, withdraw their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban and instead pledged fealty to Daesh. A former member of the TTP, Hafiz Saeed Khan, from the Orakzai Agency, is appointed the head of Daesh Pakistan and Afghanistan branch.</span>

In a seven-minute video, posted online, twelve men dressed in black tunics, wielding guns and knives, hold up a banner reading, “Sympathizers of the Islamic State in Pakistan.” The video, which could not be independently verified, ends with an audio message by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the militant group, believed to be hiding in Mosul, Iraq, today.
